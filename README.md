## Usage
```bash
# for training metra
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --headless --task=a1_tilt_metra

# for playing
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task=a1_tilt_metra --load_run={folder_path} --checkpoint=-1 

```


## Repository Structure ##
* `legged_gym`: contains the isaacgym environment and config files.
    - `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/a1/`: contains all the training config files.
    - `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/base/`: contains all the environment implementation.
    - `legged_gym/legged_gym/utils/terrain/`: contains the terrain generation code.
* `rsl_rl`: contains the network module and algorithm implementation. You can copy this folder directly to your robot.
    - `rsl_rl/rsl_rl/algorithms/`: contains the algorithm implementation.
    - `rsl_rl/rsl_rl/modules/`: contains the network module implementation.
 
## Training in Simulation ##
To install and run the code for training A1 in simulation, please clone this repository and follow the instructions in  [legged_gym/README.md](legged_gym/README.md).

## Hardware Deployment ##
To deploy the trained model on your real robot, please follow the instructions in [Deploy.md](Deploy.md).


## Trouble Shooting ##
If you cannot run the distillation part or all graphics computing goes to GPU 0 dispite you have multiple GPUs and have set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, please use docker to isolate each GPU.

## To Do (will be done before Nov 2023) ##
- [x] Go1 training configuration (not from scratch)
- [ ] A1 deployment code
- [x] Go1 deployment code
